When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When you are working with other people on a project or you are working on a project
from multiple computers.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Someone else may push something to GitHub while you're working on a file in that repository.
If it automatically stayed up-to-date it may overwrite some of the changes you have made.
