What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
The .git directory is added to the repository, allowing git to track the 
history of the repository since it was created.  It also gives you the 
ability to use the various git commands on the repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?
The staging area is an area where you can add files that you want to be committed 
to your repository; it is an intermediary step.  This allows you to have files 
within your working directory that are not committed to the repository.
